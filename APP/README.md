# HomeHive APP

After creating the database, we proceeded to build a REST API in ASP.NET Core using Microsoft Visual Studio and the C# language.

First, we created the models and DTOs corresponding to the tables we were going to develop (CodigoPostal, TipoServico, TipoUtilizador, Condominios, and Servicos), as well as the GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE methods, which would later be the actions tested on the web.

Next, for the frontend, we used Microsoft Visual Studio Code, utilizing the Angular framework, which involved a combination of HTML, TypeScript, CSS, and, by personal choice, Bootstrap. As part of the process, we generated the necessary items for web development, such as modules, components, environments, and services.
